# repositorie
Welcome to Repositorie
A 2000s themed personal page project based on the idea of making websites FUNctional again. 

# Inspiration

A lot of the inspiration for this project comes from my own memories of the web in the 2000s, when websites generally had more character, life, and didn't adhere to the rigid design contraints that we have today. 
This includes websites that I visited frequently as a kid, including Neopets, GirlsGoGames, and MySpace. I was also inspired by a lecture given by [Justus Sturkenboom](https://ju5tu5.nl/) about the evolution of web design and digital gardening, and another lecture by [Vasilis van Gemert](https://vasilis.nl/) on web accessibility and creativity.
Other websites I was inspired by include:
https://dreamvalley.neocities.org/home
- [Des' Digital Journal](https://doqmeat.com/)
- [Josh](https://joo.sh/)
- [layfarts](https://layfarts.com/home)
- [The Web Design Museum](https://www.webdesignmuseum.org/)

# Features I am most proud of
My favourite features that I have implemented in this website are my media player - the Repositorie DJ on the homepage as well as the popsicle text box on the Travel page.
Each of these took me quite a while to get right, especially the DJ, but now I don't have to use spotify >:)
